# Herma
Collaborated with art director Louisiane Trotobas, HERMA is an interactive installation that re-imagines gender using light, sound, and scent. Through abstraction, the multi-sensory experience strives to de-construct the normative idea of gender representations and expectations. Gender expressions extend beyond the categorical conventions of masculinity, femininity, and androgyny. By creating unexpected encounters with perpetually moving textures and forms, HERMA explores genderâ€™s ambiguous and shape-shifting nature.
